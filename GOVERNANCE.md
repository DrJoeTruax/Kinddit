# Kinddit Governance

Kinddit is currently stewarded under a BDFL (Benevolent Dictator for Life) model with a planned transition to a Technical Steering Committee (TSC) as the project matures.

## Current leadership

* **BDFL:** DrJoeTruax (project founder)
* **Core maintainers:** Appointed by the BDFL to oversee specific areas such as frontend, API, infrastructure, and community management.

## Near-term roadmap

* **0–6 months:**
  * Solidify the open-core feature set defined in [FEATURE_GATES.md](FEATURE_GATES.md).
  * Launch public alpha infrastructure using the Docker Compose stack.
  * Establish contribution metrics and moderation guidelines.
* **6–12 months:**
  * Form the initial Technical Steering Committee (TSC) comprised of active contributors across domains.
  * Publish a public roadmap and quarterly updates.
  * Define decision-making processes for feature prioritization, release cadence, and security escalations.

## Decision making

* The BDFL has final say on project direction until the TSC is established.
* Day-to-day decisions are delegated to maintainers who own their respective subsystems.
* Proposals for major changes should be documented as Request for Comments (RFCs) and discussed in public issues before implementation.

## TSC transition plan

* The TSC will be formed once at least three independent organizations maintain active contributors.
* The TSC charter will define membership criteria, rotation schedules, and conflict resolution mechanisms.
* Upon TSC formation, the BDFL role becomes a tie-breaking vote and long-term vision steward.

## Community engagement

* Regular community calls will be scheduled once per quarter.
* Roadmap updates and meeting notes will be published in the repository under `/governance/notes` (to be created).
* Feedback loops with the safety-pack team will ensure compatibility between open and commercial offerings.
