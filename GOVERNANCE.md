# Kinddit Governance

Kinddit is governed as an open-core project.
- The core remains open and community-driven (AGPL-3.0).
- Extensions such as advanced moderation and ML require the commercial Safety Pack.

Major decisions are discussed publicly via GitHub Discussions and Issues. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
