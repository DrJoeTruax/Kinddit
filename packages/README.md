# Packages

Shared packages and libraries that are reused across Kinddit applications live here.

* `shared` — Cross-cutting utilities, types, and configuration shared by the frontend and API.
* `sdk` — Client SDKs and integration helpers released under Apache-2.0 to encourage ecosystem adoption.

Each package should maintain its own README with setup instructions, API documentation, and publishing workflows.
