# Apps

The `apps` directory hosts runnable applications within the Kinddit monorepo.

* `frontend` — A Next.js + TypeScript web client that powers the Kinddit UI, landing page, and community experiences.
* `api` — A FastAPI backend that exposes the Kinddit REST/JSON APIs, authentication flows, and moderation services.

Refer to subsystem-specific documentation inside each application as the implementation grows.
