# Kinddit

Kinddit is a safe-by-design, open-core social platform focused on public community interactions. All conversations happen in the open or through moderated ticket workflowsâ€”there are no direct messages. The public Kinddit repository contains the open features licensed under the AGPL-3.0, while the commercial safety-pack repository delivers proprietary safety augmentations.

## Project vision

* **Safety first:** Block-Lock, subtree interaction bans, public moderation tickets, and consent relay tools create transparent guardrails against abuse.
* **Open collaboration:** Core functionality is open so communities can audit and extend the platform.
* **Commercial extensions:** Advanced ML heuristics, staff dashboards, and other closed features ship via [safety-pack](https://github.com/DrJoeTruax/safety-pack).
