## Kinddit MVP Scaffold

This repository now includes a Next.js 14 (App Router) scaffold styled with Tailwind, shadcn-inspired components, and Supabase-ready utilities so you can quickly iterate on the safety-first Reddit alternative described below. Use this as the foundation for shipping the production MVP.

### Getting Started (Next.js app)

```bash
pnpm install # or npm install / yarn install
pnpm dev
```

The development server runs on http://localhost:3000. Update the values in `.env.example` and copy them to `.env.local` once you connect your Supabase project.

## Supabase & Next.js Environment

- Copy `apps/api/.env.dev` to `.env` for local API development.
- Copy `apps/frontend/.env.dev` to `.env.local` for the monorepo Next.js example.
- Create a root-level `.env.local` for the App Router scaffold with the following values:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=
```

---

## Deployment Targets

- Docker Compose definitions remain under `infra/docker/compose.yml` for local multi-service testing.
- CI is configured via `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (restored) and should be extended to cover both the API and frontend apps.
