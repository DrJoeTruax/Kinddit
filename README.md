# Kinddit V1 Spec Update

Honest answer: Your spec is over-engineered for a v1.

## What Makes Kinddit Special?

Your actual innovation is:

- 🎯 Block-Lock mechanism (unique blocking UX)
- 🎫 Public Tickets + Summary Cards (transparency)
- 🚫 No DMs (safety by design)
- 🤖 AutoMod with public rationale
- 🤝 Consent Relay (controlled contact)

None of these require:

- A monorepo
- OpenSearch
- MinIO
- Redis queues
- Terraform
- Docker orchestration

## What You Actually Need for V1

Minimal Tech Stack:

- **Next.js** (frontend + API routes) – single repo
- **PostgreSQL** (via Supabase/Railway/Neon) – managed
- **Vercel/Netlify** – deploy
- **Clerk/Auth0** – auth (skip building it)

That's it. Really.

## Why This is Better

- **Time to Market:** 4–6 weeks vs. 4–6 months
- **Validation:** Learn if people want Block‑Lock/Tickets **before** building infra
- **Iteration Speed:** Change features daily, not fight Docker configs
- **Cost:** $0–50/mo vs. thousands in DevOps time
- **Focus:** Build safety features, not infrastructure

## The Open Source Question

Your AGPL + safety‑pack model is clever, but you’re building infrastructure no one needs until you have 100K+ users.

**Better path:**

1. Build a closed MVP (Next.js + Postgres)
2. Get to 1K users, validate Block‑Lock works
3. Get feedback on Tickets/AutoMod
4. **Then** open‑source the proven features
5. Keep ML/advanced moderation closed

Reddit didn’t open-source until they were huge. You can too.

## My Recommendation

### Phase 1 (Now – 2 months): Proof of Concept

- Next.js app on Vercel
- Supabase for DB + auth
- Core features: communities, posts, comments, blocking
- Ship and get 100 real users

### Phase 2 (3–6 months): Validate Safety Features

- Add Tickets, AutoMod rules
- Test Block‑Lock in production
- Learn what actually prevents harm

### Phase 3 (6–12 months): Scale & Open Source

- Split to monorepo **if needed**
- Add Redis/search **if needed**
- Open source core, close safety ML
- Now you have proof it works

### The Brutal Truth

Your spec reads like you’re building “enterprise Reddit” on day 1. But:

- Reddit was PHP + MySQL for years
- Discord was a single codebase for years
- Twitter was a Ruby monolith until 100 M users

Start simple. Add complexity when you **need** it, not because it’s “proper architecture.”
