# Tests

This directory will store integration and end-to-end tests that span multiple Kinddit applications.

* Use this space for cross-cutting scenarios such as moderation flows, ticket escalations, and data export pipelines.
* Keep application-specific unit tests within their respective `apps/*` or `packages/*` directories.
* Provide clear instructions for setting up any test data or fixtures.

As test suites are implemented, update this README with commands, coverage expectations, and CI integration notes.
